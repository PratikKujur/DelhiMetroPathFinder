# DelhiMetroPathFinder

### Project Title: DelhiMetroPathFinder
### Description: Developed a pathfinding application for the Delhi Metro network using Dijkstra's algorithm to determine the shortest path based on time or price.
### Technologies Used: C++, Graph Theory, Dijkstra's Algorithm
### Key Contributions:
Modeled the Delhi Metro system as a graph with stations as nodes and routes as edges.
Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest path and minimum cost between stations.
Optimized the algorithm for efficient performance on large datasets representing the metro network.
Ensured accurate handling of edge cases and provided detailed error messages for invalid inputs
